                    <h3>Vaccine Confidence Is Formed Long Before the Doctor's Office</h3>
                    <p>Decisions about childhood vaccination are rarely made in clinical settings alone. Long before a parent talks to a pediatrician, they have absorbed years of stories about health, risk, care, and responsibility from the culture around them.</p>
                    <div class="insight-box">
                        <strong>Key Insight:</strong>
                        Vaccine confidence is not built in a single interaction. It accumulates over time, across culture.

                    <p>Vaccine-related stories appear everywhere - but not in the same way for everyone. Different audiences inhabit different media ecosystems, and those ecosystems carry distinct narratives about vaccines.</p>
                    <div class="insight-box">
                        <strong>Key Insight:</strong>
                        There is no single "vaccine conversation." There are many parallel ones, happening at once.

                    <h3>The Same Message Can Reassure or Alienate</h3>
                    <p>People carry cultural stories with them into every new interaction about vaccines. Past media exposure, alongside personal experiences with caregiving and healthcare, shapes how new information is interpreted.</p>

                        <strong>Key Insight:</strong>
                        When communication fails, it is often not because the information is wrong, but because the cultural context is mismatched.

                    <h3>Culture Is Where Vaccine Confidence Is Won or Lost</h3>
                    <p>If vaccine confidence is formed through culture across entertainment, social media, and everyday storytelling, then information alone is not enough. A cultural strategy is required to engage the values, identities, and emotional logic that shape how different people interpret health decisions.</p>

                        <strong>Key Insight:</strong>
                        Meeting families in their cultural worlds, before positions harden, is no longer optional. It is the condition for rebuilding confidence.

                <strong>FrameWorks and the American Academy of Pediatrics partnered with Harmony Labs</strong> to understand how culture, media, and values shape childhood vaccine confidence, and to identify how public health can engage families through the narratives and media they already engage with.

                        <p>The audience most aligned with public-health guidance experiences vaccination as simple, straightforward, and socially agreed upon. Their confidence is reinforced by high institutional trust and by media environments that normalize vaccination as routine care.</p>
                        <p><strong>From inside this bubble, it can be difficult to see why other parents struggle, hesitate, or ask questions.</strong> Over time, this blind spot has quietly shaped vaccine communication strategies, anchoring them in assumptions that do not hold for other audiences.</p>

                        <p><strong>Our data shows something different.</strong> Concerns about childhood vaccination are values-driven and predictable. That means they are addressable.

                        <p>Rebuilding confidence requires shifting from a 'right or wrong' lens to a values-based one, where concerns are treated as meaningful starting points rather than mistakes to be corrected.</p>

            <h2>Audience Profiles: Five Values-Based Audiences</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                Vaccine confidence in the U.S. is organized into five values-based audiences, each shaped by distinct beliefs, media diets, and narratives. Only one audience lives fully inside the confidence bubble - <strong>Trusting the Process</strong>. The others occupy spaces of uncertainty or resistance.
            </p>

            <div class="audience-grid">
                <div class="audience-card">

                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Core Value:</strong> Community</p>
                    <p><strong>Confidence Driver:</strong> System competence, evidence, equity</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Core Value:</strong> Autonomy</p>
                    <p><strong>Confidence Driver:</strong> Practical benefits, fairness, community</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4 style="color: #667eea;">Primary Opportunity</h4>
                    <p><strong>Caring for My People</strong> and <strong>Checking the Details</strong> offer the greatest potential for increasing vaccine confidence. These audiences are motivated by care and responsibility but need alignment, clarity, and reassurance rather than persuasion.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4 style="color: #764ba2;">Secondary Opportunity</h4>
                    <p><strong>Protecting My Family</strong> represents a secondary opportunity, where confidence can grow when information is calm, values-aligned, and practical.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4 style="color: #f39c12;">Guardrail</h4>
                    <p><strong>Calling My Own Shots</strong> functions as a guardrail: engagement here should focus on reducing backlash and keeping channels open, not on immediate persuasion.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4 style="color: #27ae60;">Amplifier</h4>
                    <p><strong>Trusting the Process</strong> serves as an amplifier—reinforcing confidence and enabling positive spillover, but not driving the strategy itself.</p>

                <strong>Critical Finding:</strong>
                Support for vaccinating "my child" does not automatically extend to vaccinating "all children." Belief in protecting one's own children is widespread, but belief in broad societal vaccination responsibility varies widely and is deeply tied to values.

                    <h3>1. Tell Complete Stories, Not Messages</h3>
                    <p>Content that produced positive movement consistently followed a clear narrative arc—with a beginning, middle, and end. Stories that showed a situation unfolding, a decision being navigated, and a concrete outcome moved audiences to bigger alignment with the narrative goal.</p>
                    <p><strong>By contrast, content that resembled public health messaging didn't create greater confidence.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>2. Center Real People and Real Stakes</h3>
                    <p>Stories worked best when they were anchored in human experience rather than abstract claims. Content that showed families, caregivers, or clinicians navigating real-world situations, especially around children's health, had more positive impacts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stakes were most persuasive when they were practical and relational, not theoretical.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>3. Show Vaccination Inside Everyday Life</h3>
                    <p>Content was more engaging when vaccination appeared incidentally within familiar life moments, such as school preparation, routine checkups, travel planning, or caregiving, rather than being framed as a standalone appeal.</p>
                    <p><strong>Placing vaccination inside everyday contexts may help audiences interpret it as a practical, routine decision</strong>, reducing its association with institutional pressure or political debate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>4. Model Responsibility, Rather Than Preach Responsibility</h3>
                    <p>Stories performed best when they showed people acting responsibly instead of being told what responsibility looks like. By depicting thoughtful, protective choices in motion, these pieces reinforced social norms without lecturing or moralizing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Responsibility became legible through behavior</strong>, allowing audiences to see it as achievable and self-directed rather than imposed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>5. Use Humor in Service of the Story, Not as the Story</h3>
                    <p>Humor should be used carefully and in service of the story, not as the story itself. While humor can lower defenses when it supports clarity and respect, it undermines trust when it trivializes illness, heightens anxiety, or displaces children from the center of the narrative.</p>
                    <p><strong>In emotionally charged contexts, tone should reinforce seriousness of purpose even when moments of levity are present.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>6. Design Stories With a Clear Narrative Job</h3>
                    <p>Stories should be designed with a clear narrative job in mind, aligned to a specific dimension of vaccine confidence. The findings show that child development, social norms, and collective benefit do not move together.</p>
                    <p><strong>Attempting to advance all of these at once risks diluting impact or activating resistance.</strong> Greater effectiveness comes from clarity about which belief a story is intended to influence.</p>
